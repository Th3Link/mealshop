# Mealshop

Recipes, informed nutrition, shopping and family meal planning. **Early development:** a
Rust HTTP server now includes an ingredient catalogue and nutrition workbench (F02, under review).
The broader product features below remain planned.

## Vision
- Ingredient database, precise configurable units, scalable recipes, macro- and micronutrients
  per serving, and evidence-backed explanations of beneficial food components.
- Shared recipes and later paid recipes/collections; source-link-only sharing for imported recipes.
- Shopping lists with recipe provenance, extra items, preferred shops, learned aisle order and barcodes.
- Family meal plans with attendance, intolerances, preferences, cooking time and ongoing feedback.
- Guided cooking with preset timers, multi-day bread/pizza schedules, and later brewing/fermentation.
- Inventory, offers, customer-operated link imports and MCP recipe tools.

## Run the ingredient and nutrition workbench
Install stable Rust (declared minimum: 1.85), then:
```sh
cargo run --locked
curl --fail http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
```
The response is `ok` plus a newline. `MEALSHOP_LISTEN_ADDR` overrides `127.0.0.1:3000`.
Open [the workbench](http://127.0.0.1:3000/) to calculate recipe/serving nutrients and inspect
sources, unknowns and component evidence. The starter catalogue includes USDA oats/chia data
and an identity-only psyllium record. [Demo, API and custom catalogue guide](docs/guides/nutrition.md).
Use Ctrl-C for graceful shutdown. There is no household authentication or saved recipe data
yet. Tests: `cargo test --locked`. Full gate: [development guide](docs/guides/development.md).

## Deployment and business model (planned)
Rust/Tokio/Axum server, standalone or as a Nextcloud `ExApp`; Flutter client connecting to an
own server or our hosted service. Storage options: Git-backed files, PostgreSQL, SQLite and
MariaDB. Nextcloud installations remain free. Hosted accounts have free and paid tiers.
The distributed app costs a few euros; self-compilation and installation remain possible.
Only paid, signed app releases are intended to connect to our operated service; technical
admission and licensing details need validation (ADR 0004). Future federation may exchange
recipes and compatible meal plans between independent servers.

The repository uses spec-driven development inspired by Curvyo and CI adapted from
homeautomation; exact source revisions and adaptation notes are in [provenance](docs/provenance.md).
